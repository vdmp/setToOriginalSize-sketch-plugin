# Set To Original Size sketch plugin

A tiny plugin for resetting sizes of symbol instances via shortcut

In Sketch you can resize symbol instance back to original symbol size from context menu. But there is no way to set up shortcut for it, so iâ€™ve made this tiny plugin to make it possible.

How to use:
1. Install plugin
2. Select one or multiple symbols and hit cmd+shift+f to resize. All symbols in selected group will be resized to their original sizes. Thats it!

If you want you always can change shortcut via System Preference

Have a nice day!
